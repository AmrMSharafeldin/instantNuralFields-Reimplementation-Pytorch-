# Instant Neural Radiance Fields - Reimplementation in PyTorch

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of a NERF model with accelerated training time. It includes a case study involving the following papers:

- [Plenoxels: Radiance Fields without Neural Networks by Yu and Fridovich-Keil et al](https://example.com/plenoxels)
- [Neural Geometric Level of Detail: Real-time Rendering with Implicit 3D Shapes by Takikawa et al., 2021](https://example.com/nglod)
- [Instant Neural Graphics Primitives with a Multiresolution Hash Encoding by MÃ¼ller et al](https://example.com/instant_neural_graphics_primitives)
